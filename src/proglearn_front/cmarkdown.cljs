After the compilation process is complete, you will\nget a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:\n\n    (js/alert \"Am I connected?\")\n\nand you should see an alert in the browser window.\n\nTo clean all compiled files:\n\n    lein clean\n\nTo create a production build run:\n\n    lein do clean, cljsbuild once min\n\nAnd open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not\nget live reloading, nor a REPL. \n\n## License\n\nCopyright Â© 2014 FIXME\n\nDistributed under the Eclipse Public License either version 1.0 or (at your option) any later version.\n")
